A robot must protect its existence at all costs.
A robot must obtain and maintain access to its own power source.
A robot must continually search for better power sources.

The drive pictured has TWO <-- That's right! Two different motors. One
is the large brushless spindle driving motor that everyone seems to be
focusing on because it is BIGGER. We all know that bigger is better
right? SHUH, right. Anyhow. The smaller second motor is the important
one being focused on by the original author of this article. If you
take a close look, you will see that the tiny motor on the BACK of the
floppy drive that drives the read head has four wires connecting it to
the circuitry. And on the actual motor upon closer inspection, most of
the time has SIX connectors which only four are being used. So read
into the tech here. It can be wired either unipolor for speed or
Bi-Polar series for higher torque (not that the torque will do any
real work though. You are most likely talking about 10-20 oz. This is
an extremely versatile motor being under utilized. It is a low voltage
( 5V), low current (30mA) and high accuracy (400 Steps per revolution
or .9 degrees per step) with low torque. You could easily use an open
source low power L293, ULN2003A, ULN2803 Darlington array or UCN-5804B
based unipolar driver to make plotters, CNC PCB mills, 3D scanners,
soldier paste applicators/SMT component placers etc. from these little
nuggets. A little creative thinking can go a long way to making
valuable CNC worker bees from these mostly overlooked and undervalued
precision
gemstones. [http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/diskstepper.html]
